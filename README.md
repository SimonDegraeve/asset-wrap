Asset-Wrap is a simple asset manager for node.

## Goals
1. build at anytime (server start or on any callback)
2. support stylus, less, and sass to build your css
3. support snockets to build your javascript
4. use async whenever possible
5. support cluster

## Install
```
npm install asset-wrap
```

## Details
### Asset
A wrapped asset, whether using snockets, stylus, sass, or less.

All assets require at a minimum two parameters
* `src`: the path to your source file
* `dst`: the location to serve your file from (with md5 appended). also the cache key

After "wrapping" your asset, it will contain
* `url`: the dst with the md5 appended
* `data`: the wrapped content
* `ext`: the file extension of the wrapped asset
* `md5`: the md5 of the wrapped content
* `tag`: the full html tag to render

### Assets
A group of `Asset`s. Use this if you need a single callback to compile multiple
assets or if you want your assets served through middleware.

## Examples
### Use as Middleware
```
wrap = require 'asset-wrap'
assets = wrap.AssetWrap [
  new wrap.Stylus {
    src: "#{__dirname}/path/to/app.styl"
    dst: '/css/app.css'
    compress: true
  }
  new wrap.Snockets {
    src: "#{__dirname}/path/to/app.coffee"
    dst: '/js/app.js'
    compress: false
  }
]

assets.on 'complete', () ->
  console.log 'assets compiled'

app.configure () ->
  app.use assets.middleware

@get '/': ->
  @render index: {
    assets: assets
  }

@view index: ->
  head ->
    @assets.tag '/css/app.css'
    @assets.tag '/js/app.js'
```

### Single Asset Dynamically
```
wrap = require '../src/wrap'
asset = new wrap.Snockets {
  src: "#{__dirname}/test.coffee"
  dst: '/js/app.js'
}
asset.on 'complete', () ->
  console.log asset.url
asset.wrap()
```

### Single Asset Dynamically Shortcut
```
asset = new wrap.Snockets {
  src: "#{__dirname}/test.coffee"
  dst: '/js/app.js'
}, (asset) ->
  console.log asset.url
```

### Wrap Single Asset with Zappa
```
@get '/js/app.js': ->
  new wrap.Snockets {
    url: '/js/app.js'
    src: "#{__dirname}/path/to/app.coffee"
  }, (asset) =>
    @response.setHeader 'Content-Type', 'text/javascript'
    @response.write asset.data
```
